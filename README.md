Magic Leap Pedestrian Crash Data Analysis

Overview: 
This project, developed by the Magic Leap team, explores pedestrian crashes in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) using data from 2012 to 2021 provided by the ACT Government Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate. The goal is to understand the types of crashes and contributing factors and propose safety measures to minimize these incidents, aligning with the "Towards Vision Zero" initiative.

Team:
Alisha Baniya – U3245851
Sebastian Joseph – U3244376
Sai Likhita Damarla – U3244478

Objective:
Explore pedestrian crash data in ACT.
Analyze crash types and features contributing to these incidents.
Recommend measures aimed at achieving the ‘Vision Zero’ initiative to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries.
Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the ACT Government's open data platform:
Pedestrian Crashes Data (2012-2021)

Key Findings:
Pedestrian crashes make up a significant portion of on-road accidents, with around 4% resulting in fatalities.
Crashes are more frequent during morning (8:00 AM) and evening (3:00 PM) peak hours.
Initiatives such as road safety cameras (implemented in May 2015) have contributed to mitigating crash rates.
COVID-19 led to an increase in pedestrian and cyclist activities, prompting the "Slower Streets" campaign to reduce traffic speeds.
Visualizations:
An interactive dashboard has been created to explore the data and visualize crash hotspots, time-based patterns, and severity of incidents.

Recommendations:
Speed Cameras: More speed cameras should be installed in high-crash areas.
Slower Speed Campaigns: Continue promoting campaigns aimed at reducing speed in pedestrian-heavy zones.
Road Enhancements: Modify roads to include wider shoulders to prevent run-off-road and head-on collisions.
Public Education: Encourage road safety education, especially for vulnerable groups like school children and elderly pedestrians.

Conclusion
This analysis shows that while several measures have been effective in reducing crashes, further improvements in speed management, road infrastructure, and public awareness are necessary to move towards achieving ‘Vision Zero’ in the ACT.
